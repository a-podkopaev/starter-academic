Hey there! Iâ€™m a 4th year PhD student in the joint program between [Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu) and [Machine Learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) departments at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas). We consider the topics around building reliable ML systems, and in particular, distribution-free uncertainty quantification (conformal prediction, calibration) and adaptations to the presence of distribution shifts. Before joining CMU, I obtained BSc and MSc degrees at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) and [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/).
